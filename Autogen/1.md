AutoGen can be used to define agent interaction behaviors. Developers can use both natural language and computer code to program flexible conversation patterns for different applications. By automating chat among multiple LLM agents, developers can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code.

<h1>Key features of Microsoft AutoGen</h1>
- AutoGen provides multi-agent conversation framework as a high-level abstraction. With this framework, one can conveniently build LLM workflows.
- AutoGen offers a collection of working systems spanning a wide range of applications from various domains and complexities.
- AutoGen supports enhanced LLM inference APIs, which can be used to improve inference performance and reduce cost.
