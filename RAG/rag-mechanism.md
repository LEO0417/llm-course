Core Mechanism of RAG
RAG operates by integrating two primary components: Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). This combination allows the model to retrieve pertinent information from a vast corpus of documents and use it to inform the generation of responses. The workflow can be summarized in the following steps:

1. Data Collection: The first step involves gathering domain-specific textual data from various external sources, such as PDFs, articles, and databases. This data forms the foundation of the knowledge base that the RAG system will utilize.
2. Embedding: Both the documents and the queries are embedded into a shared latent space, enabling the model to understand the context and relevance of the information.
3. Retrieval: When a query is made, the system retrieves the most relevant document chunks based on the embeddings, ensuring that the information is both accurate and up-to-date.
4. Generation: The retrieved information is then passed to the generative model, which produces a response that is informed by the external data, resulting in higher quality outputs.
