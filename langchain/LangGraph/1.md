# LangGraph Implementation in LangChain
### Overview
This project is an implementation of the innovative LangGraph concept within the LangChain ecosystem. LangGraph utilizes language agents organized as a graph to revolutionize the way we approach internet searches. By integrating multiple agents with specific tools from LangChain, this system demonstrates a potential future for internet search technologies.

#### Features
Multiple Language Agents: Utilizes different agents, each equipped with unique tools, to process and retrieve information.
LangGraph Framework: Implements the LangGraph concept, showcasing interconnected and dynamic information processing.
Gradio Interface: Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface to interact with the LangGraph system.
